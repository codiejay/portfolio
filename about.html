                                <p>Growing up in a city where we were barely exposed to technology, As kids we got to play with mere toys but I am some friend wanted way more that "Mere". So we would take toy cars, break radios apart, rip the radios off their rotors, and fix them unto the toy car's tires. For weeks we would try and try and until it moved. And just then, speaking for myself, my love for tech got lit! </p>

                                <h3>11-18Years</h3>
                                <p>With my kind of burning love for tech i just couldn't make it into the Sci. Dept. Of my Secondary School, So i opted for bussiness since i was already parcticing that in class. I would write lenghty noted for friends and charge them a fee which i used to but candies of course and treat my friends on our way home. But tech never left me someway. So right after Secondary schhol in the early parts of the year 2017 i head of Mysql(language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database) and thought it was a Movie, Googled it, And BOOM! I am becoming a Software Engr. </p>
