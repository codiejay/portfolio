                                        <p class="pbox">As my favorite instructor would love to say it, HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language), Is what makes the web, THE WEB! As almost easy and cliche it may have become over the years, HTML is what every website needs to be a website. From CMS  to Finger knitted  websites all of them happened because of this language and so i have acquired  the basic and most import knowledge of this language and of course, This website was built first on HTML ONLY!  </p>

                                        <img src="images/css.png" alt="">
                                        <p class="pbox">Remember how we said HTML was all the website are, Maybe we exaggerated a little, You see, website built on HTML only aren't so pleasant and beautiful  and since our websites would be visited 90% of the time  by humans we have to make them that- Beautiful and pleasant. And CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) is just the right tool for that. It like a painting to a home made of brick( HTML could be called the bricks. ). But it could get as tricky as a buffet-You just don't know where to start  so frameworks like bootstrap are made available so writing  CSS becomes FUN! I am also on my path to learning such Technologies!</p>

                                        <p class="pbox">JavaScript is the programming language of the web. But please, don't get me wrong, it can be used for a lot of things from mobile development sing PhoneGap and Cordova to Desktop Apps. But most times this awesome language has been in-cooperated in websites to improves their interactivity with your human users. I am, currently also trying to get this into my tool box and it been exciting!</p>
